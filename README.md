# 🍷 Wine Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description
This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to classify different types of wine based on their chemical properties. It explores **Random Forest** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifiers, along with **hyperparameter tuning** using `GridSearchCV`.

## 🚀 Features
- Data Visualization (Countplots, Correlation Heatmap)
- Model Training (Random Forest, KNN)
- Hyperparameter Tuning for Optimization
- Performance Evaluation using Accuracy & Confusion Matrix
- Predicting Wine Class for Unknown Data

## 📂 Dataset
The project utilizes the **Wine dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`, which consists of:
- **178 samples**
- **13 features** describing chemical compositions
- **3 target classes** representing different wine categories

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yasirpt07/Wine-Classification-ML.git

## 📊 Results
Random Forest Accuracy: 100%
KNN Accuracy: 72%
Best Hyperparameter Combination: { 'n_estimators': 100, 'max_depth': None, 'min_samples_split': 2 }

## 🔬 Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using:
Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Feature Importance Visualization
